# M2_Embedded-Project
INTRODUCTION

In this project we are going to design a circuit for measuring temperature. This circuit is developed using “LM35”, a linear voltage sensor. Temperature is usually measured in “Centigrade". “LM35” sensor provides output based on scale of centigrade.
LM35 is three pin transistor like device. It has VCC, GND and OUTPUT. 

FEATURES

Digital thermometers are temperature-sensing instruments that are easily portable.

Have permanent probes. 

A convenient digital display.


WORKING & CIRCUIT DIAGRAM

LM35 is an analog sensor that converts the surrounding temperature to a proportional analog voltage. The output from the sensor is connected to one of the ADC channel inputs of the Atmega32 microcontroller to derive the equivalent temperature value in digital format.
